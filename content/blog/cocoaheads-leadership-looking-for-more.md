A message from Mike Zornek, Lead Organizer:

Hey everyone. Hope all is going well. At the last meeting I shared some news with those in attendance and want to now share it with you all.

After much consideration I've decided to step down from the Philly CocoaHeads leadership.

It has been my honor and privilege over the last seven years to help organize Philly CocoaHeads. I'm extremely proud of the community we've grown and step down knowing it will continue to thrive in the years ahead. I still plan to be an active member but am also looking forward to a few extra hours a month to dedicate to other projects.

As for my responsibilities, we'll be holding an event, a [Leadership Open Town Hall](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/243367373/) on Monday October 2nd at 6:30pm. If you are interested in seeing the continued success of Philly CocoaHeads and can volunteer your time please consider attending. There are plenty of responsibilities, small and large, to go around. I could easily see multiple people split up main meeting items, in addition to website maintenance and such. I do think one person should be considered the head organizer, to keep the money centralized and ultimately guide the group.

My hope is to identify those who are interested in helping out and transitioning them into the roles by the end of the year.

Thanks again to everyone who makes our small community as good as it can be.

~ Mike Zornek
