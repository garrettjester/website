---

[360iDev](https://360idev.com/) is a popular long standing iOS conference out of Denver Colorado. This year's conference is being held August 13-16, 2017 and like previous years they have [reached out](https://360idev.com/cocoaheads/) to the CocoaHead community.

We were given two (2) free tickets to this year's conference and did a raffle for them. Congrats to Logan Henderson and Joshua Auriemma on their ticket winnings. We look forward to hearing what you learned at the conference at an upcoming meeting.

For the rest, please consider using the coupon code “cocoacommunity” for 15% off all tickets. It's a great conference and I'm sure you'll have a good time.
