After being on the wishlist for a while we are finally putting some effort into updating our group's website.

The main tool we're using is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site creator written in Go. The [website repo](https://github.com/phillycocoa/website) is open source and we encourage everyone to check it out and offer feedback and updates. Thanks for your interest.
