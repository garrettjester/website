title: "More Info on the Main Meeting Improvements"
---

We have a lot of tweaks/improvements planed for the main meeting format and to help set expectations I wanted to post some notes beforehand.

First, the next meeting ([Thursday, July 13th](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/237755719/)) will be held at [IndyHall](https://www.indyhall.org/) instead of the Apple Store. We [announced this change back in May](/blog/july-meeting-moving-back-to-indyhall/) and we hope the more open floor plan of IndyHall will let us do things we could not before, as well as host more people. More venue info is also on the [official agenda page](/meeting-agenda).

Second, the meeting will be returning to it's previous times of 6:30pm to 9:00pm. We hope the later starting time will help people who have to commute to CocoaHeads from a job somewhere far away. If you do arrive early there is plenty of desk space to use at IndyHall while we setup. There are also numerous coffee shops in the area such as [Menagerie](http://www.menageriecoffee.com/), [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/store-locator/store/13851/3rd-arch-57-63-north-third-street-philadelphia-pa-191064508), and [Old City Coffee](https://oldcitycoffee.com/) if that is more your cup of tea, er coffee.

Third, we are expanding the social time and introducing a "Help Board" system to assist people who are wrestling with a code issue or looking for assistance to find some help. This kind of pairing has been very successful at Side Project Saturdays and we want to bring a piece of it to our main meeting.

When you arrive you'll be invited to post your issue or question to the Help Board which will be on the projector. From there other members will self match (come to the welcome desk and offer your help!) and/or we'll do our best to find someone for you. Some examples of issues or questions you might want to bring include:

* Bugs and Broken Behavior
* Code Review
* App Idea Review
* UI Review
* App Architecture Review / Brainstorms
* Framework Introductions
* Build Automation
* Testing Improvements
* Resume Review
* Job Interview Practice

So please feel comfortable sharing an issue and making use of the different expertise of your peers. You'll do the same for someone else down the line.

Some other small tweaks you may notice at the meeting, include new name tags (be sure to pick one up at entrance and be sure to say hi to a new face!) as well as more food options (we'll be getting some pizzas as well as hoagie trays -- fill our our [food survey](https://goo.gl/forms/mEWZFejNQykZaTSu2) to let your preferences or special requests be known).

After the meeting please let us know how it went for you (Email <leadership@phillycocoa.org>). We value your feedback tremendously.
