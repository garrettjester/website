title: "Main Meeting Moving Back to IndyHall in July"
---

The next main meeting for Philly CocoaHeads will be [June 15th at the Apple Store](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/239190782/). For our [July 13th meeting](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/237755719/) we are headed back to [IndyHall](https://www.indyhall.org/).

For long time members you may remember we originally met at IndyHall. These days IndyHall is at a new venue on 4th and Market Street, in the Colonial Penn Building. They have a very large and open floor plan with an education and gallery space. We hope this new space will help us execute some changes to our main meeting format to help provide better social and mentoring time. 

I know many of us have fond feelings for the Apple Store Briefing Room space but we hope the planned improvements to our meeting format will help make it a worth while change.

If you have any questions or concerns, please send us an email to <leadership@phillycocoa.org>. Thanks.
