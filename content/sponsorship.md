# Sponsorship

Philly CocoaHeads has always tried to have a very low barrier of entry for participation. Consequently, we do not have any formal membership dues or event fees. We do however have real running costs (from pizza to hosting services) and welcome sponsorship from companies that benefit from our presence in the community and who are looking to reach out to Apple developers.

Sponsorship is offered per month for $200. Should you decide to sponsor you'll get:

* Ad placement on our website.
* Promotion in our email meeting announcements.
* Mention during the group news of the main monthly meeting.
* An opportunity to speak at the meeting to plug your product or job opportunity.

Payment can be made via check or we can send you a PalPal invoice which can be paid using a credit card.

If you are interested, please contact us at <leadership@phillycocoa.org>.
