## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll receive $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advantage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell: Downlink - Anthony Colangelo
Anthony gives us a demo of a new Mac app he's built:
"Watch sunlight and weather patterns move across Earth throughout the day, and bask in the glory of our blue marble in real time.
Every 20 minutes (or every hour, you pick), Downlink updates your desktop background with the newest images of Earth.
Choose from 8 different views of Earth, including stunning full disk images from 3 different geostationary satellites."

Edan will talk about the purpose of the app, the way it was built, coordinating people across the country, some of the challenges and then talk about the code base - “coordinator pattern” and his main contribution which was the timer and the audio recording.

### WWDC Retrospective Round Table
