When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll receive $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advantage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell: "My first macOS App is Amazing" - Walt Mankowski
A friend of mine started a programming book club, and our first book is Jamis Buck's Mazes for Programmers. I started doing the exercises in Python, but I reached a point where ASCII art wasn't going to cut it anymore. I thought it would make a good beginner's project to learn enough Swift and Cocoa to rewrite it as a macOS app. I'll demo the app, give a quick tutorial on creating mazes, and talk about what I learned in the process

### Show and Tell: Road to iOS13: Next Gen UI Design with SwiftUI/Combine - Kotaro Fujita
Making very sleek and amazing UI layouts and animations use to involve a lot of long winded code and state management. SwiftUI/Combine now gives us so much power with so little code. You will be see apps with way more compelling interactions and animations.

We are going to create an amazing app in 20 mins with slick gestures and animations. By the end of this show-and-tell, you will realize that we are about to enter a new age of app UI/UX.

### Show and Tell: Road to iOS13: PencilKit - Kotaro Fujita
PencilKit is a framework that allows you to instantly add pencil support to your app. You may wonder why you might need/want something like this and Kotaro will try to provide some compelling use cases.

Get an in-depth look at this new framework that gives you easy access to the note taking tools for your app.
