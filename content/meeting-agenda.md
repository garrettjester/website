## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll recieve $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advangage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the main meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell: Logging in Production - Curtis Herbert
Debugging issues with your app once it hits the App Store can be ... fun ... sometimes. That dreaded "it doesn't work" email from a customer, in which they provide no useful information and there's no crash log to help you. Curtis is going to walk through a logging framework, CocoaLumberjack, and a few techniques he's come up with, to make his life debugging customer issues much less painful.
