## Presentations

### Test Driven iOS development: Andy Obusek
Automated testing tools for iOS have come a long way since the initial release of the iPhone SDK. Learn how to improve your app’s quality by using TDD to build code at various layers of an application. You’ll learn what test driven development is, how it can be used in unit tests to verify simple model objects, code that uses a remote API, and user interface code. As a bonus, you’ll also learn some tricks for writing tests easier.
