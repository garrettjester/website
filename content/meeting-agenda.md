## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll receive $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advantage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell: How to Kill An App Part 3: Instant Death - Kotaro Fujita
This is part 3 of a 3 part show-n-tell series. We go thru the life cycle of an app on how you take an idea to the finish line to maintaining and growing an app to finally the death of an app. We will use my app, Dividend Calc to illustrate how I have built it, grew it, and eventually killed it.

In part 3, we explore how an app can suddenly become a liability and eventually force a tough decision on whether or not it should continue to exist in the App Store. We explore cost/benefit analysis and post application support.

### Creating an Inclusive Code Review Culture - Kayla Kasprak
As a developer, you've probably experienced the familiar dread surrounding code reviews–-having to context switch to unblock someone’s pull request or deciding how to move forward after a comment with which you disagreed. Transform the code review culture of your team with these tips and techniques, improving code quality and working relationships simultaneously.
