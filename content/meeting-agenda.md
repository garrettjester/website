## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll recieve $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advangage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell: Curtis Herbert
If you've ever used the Analyze build command before, you're familiar with the idea of linters: a set of tools to automatically help you flag issues within your code. SwiftLint lets you take this a bit further and enforce style guidelines and treat violations of them as warnings or errors. Curtis will run through his experience setting up SwiftLint on a code base that's been around since Swift 1.1.

### From Apps to dApps: What Mobile Devs Should Know About Blockchain: Ben DiFrancesco 
You've heard the hype around bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain - but what is this new technology really about? What should a developer, specifically a mobile developer, know about blockchain. How might it effect our work as mobile devs in the future. In this talk, we'll break down blockchain basics, assess the current state of the tech, and explore the future possibilities from the perspective of a mobile engineer.
