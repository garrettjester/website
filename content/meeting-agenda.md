## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advangage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Designing a Modern Swift Network Stack: Michael Zornek
When an app is young and has simple networking needs it's not uncommon to use URLSession tasks directly inside of a view controller. However as the app needs grow to include things like authenticated requests, token renewal, testing, cancelation, caching and more -- you'll wantto have a more defined networking stack to lean on. On a client project over the summer, the iOS team and I started to document a networking wish list and over the past few months we've started to execute it, first on some smaller features and a demos app. Now we are preparing for a new greenfield iOS app where we should be able to hit the ground running with our new ideas.

In this talk I'll review the network design we've come up with. I'll demo what we have working and talk about how we want to extend it in the future. Attendee should walk away with new ideas that they can integrate into their own networking code.

### Show and Tell: UI/UX Tricks and Tools - Kotaro Fujita
Over my career, I have done a ton of front-end design work for many clients. This meeting, I will do live demos of some tricks and tools that I've learned over the years to help clients get a better sense of their final product.
