## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll receive $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!


## Meeting Agenda

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advantage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell:Film is (not) dead? - Rich Boutwell
Richard Boutwell will do a show and tell presentation of his prototype camera app, and demo writing metal kernels and a metal rendering pipeline to simulate different traditional films and color filtration for real time previews.

### Show and Tell: How to Kill An App Part 2: Always Be Selling - Kotaro Fujita
This is part 2 of a 3 part show-n-tell series. We go thru the life cycle of an app on how you take an idea to the finish line to maintaining and growing an app to finally the death of an app. We will use my app, Dividend Calc to illustrate how I have built it, grew it, and eventually killed it.

In part 2, the application is launch but what now. Not many downloads. Not much engagement. We explore the multiple ways to bring awareness to the app and its eventually steady growth.

### Lessons Learned in a Rearchitecture - Alex Nagl
At CBS Interactive we just finished rearchitecting and redesign our app. During that time we had to make the large decision on which design pattern to use. We decided to keep it simple and go with MVC for a few reasons, while still gaining some of the benefits that MVVM and the other patterns like to boast about. This presentation will discuss the experiences gained and the challenges.
