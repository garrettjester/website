## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll receive $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advantage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell: How to Kill An App Part 1: Rise of The App Idea - Kotaro Fujita
This is part 1 of a 3 part show-n-tell series. We go thru the life cycle of an app on how you take an idea to the finish line to maintaining & growing an app to finally dealing with the death of an app. We will use my app, Dividend Calc to illustrate how I have built it, grew it, and eventually killed it.

In part 1, we go over how a basic personal need to figuring out my total dividends turned into my creation for the app, Dividend Calc. We go over the inspiration, the process and the eventual release of this app.

### Show and Tell: Making Chat Bubbles Dance - Edan Lichtenstein
It takes 3 to tango: Time, Movement, and Opacity come together in a single cell insertion. When designers ask for special animations requiring a collection view, here's an overview of the 3 classes that move together to handle custom animations for cell insertion. Then I'll show tests created to make sure no one changes your weeks of work in the future.

### Misconceptions about iOS Memory Management - Mohammed Faanik
During this talk I’ll discuss different types of memory issues. I'll explain how not every memory issue is a leak and will share tips on how to spot memory related issues quicker. I'll also show where the usage of Xcode is recommended and where it’s not.
