# December Meeting Agenda

Philly CocoaHeads always meets on the second Thursday of every month at IndyHall, located at 4th and Market (the 3rd floor of the Colonial Penn Building).

Please RSVP via Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/> so we can order the appropriate amount of pizza and hoagies for our social hour!

## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll recieve $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advangage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Formal Meeting

Our meetings are a mix of formal presentations and show-and-tells. We welcome talk proposals of all skill level, and all speaker experience level.

Speaking for the first time and want something with minimal pressure, or just have a cool project / CocoaPod / etc you want to share with the group quick? Consider giving a show-and-tell which usually run around 15 minutes.

Get in touch with the leadership team at <leadership@phillycocoa.org> to propose something!

## Post-Meeting Drinks

After meeting drinks will commence at 2nd Story Brewing Co at 117 Chestnut Street.
