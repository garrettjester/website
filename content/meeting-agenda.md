## Presentations

### The making of Anchor, a Mac app for instant file sharing: Kostas Nasis <kostas@nasis.com>
Kostas will discuss the making of the Anchor app, a Mac application built with a combination of Electron, VueJS, and native Swift code. This talk will cover the pros and cons of using Electron, the challenges faced, and how to leverage a mix of hybrid and native development to dramatically improve iteration speed and time to market without sacrificing quality.

### Show and Tell: Edan Lichtenstein <edanl@outlook.com>
Edan will give insight into how you can land jobs - basically to not ignore recruiters - and he will share the "luck" he's had twice now with recruiters.  We often discount them and they're a dime a dozen, but its worth it to give each one some time.
