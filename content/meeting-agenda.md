### 3 Days to Rethink Slopes for Apple Watch: Joseph Cieplinski <joec@mac.com>
This winter, Curtis Herbert was in the midst of a massive rewrite of the Apple Watch version of his app Slopes. The work was mostly back-end related. There was no planned update for the user interface. Until…

One day, Curtis received an unsolicited drawing from a User Experience expert (who shall remain nameless), suggesting a possible new approach to Slopes’ watch UI that was fairly compelling. It was just a sketch, but once he saw it, the seed was planted.

There was just one problem: Where to find the time? The big release was on the horizon. The peak season was well underway. Delay was not an option. How could he fit this in?

This is where I came in.

In this talk, I’ll tell the story of how I became involved in helping Curtis with this UI rewrite. We’ll explore the difference between a sketch from a UE expert and an implemented design from a UI expert. The technologies involved in the new watchOS interface. Some of the unique challenges involved with small-screen interface design. And more.
