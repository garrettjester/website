## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll receive $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When the doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advantage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of. The outside doors are locked by 7:00PM, so come join us for the Social Hour before the Main Meeting begins.

## Presentations
### Show and Tell - Charles Proxy on iOS - Stephen Tolton
Charles is an HTTP proxy / HTTP monitor / Reverse Proxy that enables a developer to view all of the HTTP and SSL / HTTPS traffic between their machine and the Internet. This includes requests, responses and the HTTP headers (which contain the cookies and caching information).

We now have an iOS version.

Learn how to test and debug your network calls for your app using this iOS version of a wonderful app. Stephen shows you the basic as well as a few advance techniques for testing more secure connections.

### Show and Tell - SwiftUI: Demo with Fav10 app - Kotaro Fujita
Do you remember your top 10 favorite movies of all time? Thats the elevator pitch for this app and it is the first app I fully developed in SwiftUI.

But that's not all the iOS13 tech we get to explore. Core Data/Cloudkit sync is a huge part of this app and you will get to see how the app is constructed. We also explore Coordinators, View Modifiers, ViewRepresentables/ViewControllerRepresentables and other cool things that make develop.

We show it all in a fun demonstration of the speed in which a SwiftUI app can be built.

### Lightening Talk - UI/UX: Neumorphism - Kotaro Fujita
We've seen the evolution of web/mobile UI/UX from Skeumorphism to Flat Design to Material Design. Now a new design language is emerging as a contender for the next generation of UI/UX trends. We explore the pros/cons of Neumorphism.
