## Before the Meeting
We meet out of <a href="https://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, a co-working community in Old City. They've extended a discount to our group to come in early and work out of Indy Hall for the day. When you get there, mention CocoaHeads and you'll recieve $10 off the normal drop-in rate (you'll get in for $20). Many CocoaHeads members are also Indy Hall members, so you'll see some of us around. Avoid the rush hour commute and join us!

## Social Hour
When doors open we kick off the meeting with our social hour. Don't skip out on this - it's the perfect time to say hi to new members, hack on a side project, and pick each others' brains about problems you're running into. Bring your laptop and take advangage of our helpful community to push through that problem you just can't quite seem to Stack Overflow your way out of.

## Presentations
### Online privacy and data integrity: Stephan Matanovic
Have you heard about GDPR, the CLOUD Act, or SESTA/FOSTA? Confused by what they are, or how they could affect your business? In the last few months, new regulations have been introduced that impact just about everybody who does business on the internet. Stephan Matanovic - a technology and business lawyer - will lead an exploration of these three new regulatory frameworks and how they will directly impact life on the internet for individuals and businesses.

### Show and Tell: Justin Katzwhite
NFC based, Cloud powered Restaurant POS. Because the full realization of the service is any kind of device (iOS /Android/Web) being able to communicate with a cloud network, I need the other half of the smartphone market (iOS). I developed the Android version and it is commercially available (functional, no errors, navigable interface, maybe not the best to look at). I'm now looking to work with someone that can help with iOS.
